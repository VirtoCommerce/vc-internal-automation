# vc-internal-automation

We have some standard tools like Office 365, Github, Jira (Tempo) and probably some more. We have a need to sync data between those tools, make manual operations, validations, control, prepare data for reporting and so on. This initiative is to have a way to automate some processes, so we could save/optimize a man-hours. It will also give a transparency, so others could reuse the automated processes for similar tasks.

We decided to use LogicApp for building workflows. The workflows sources, artifacts and description will keep in this repository.
